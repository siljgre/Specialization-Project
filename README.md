# Content Description

This repository contains the most important files for the specialization project TKP4580.
Each model has its own folder including simulation files, parameter estimation files, and experimental data.
The experimental data is the same in each model, but is included in all folders such that all files can be run without having to change the file paths in the scripts.

The folder "Monte Carlo Results" contains .xlsx files for all runs of the Monte Carlo simulation presented in the report, including calculation of median and MAD.
